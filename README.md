Okay, so basically this is just some really, truly bad Python code
that I wrote once on a train in 2019 at the absolute last minute as
part of an art exhibition I did. Like this is utterly embarrassing
code and I am not at all convinced that it has any usefulness for
sigil magick. I cannot emphasize enough that this is useless software
written badly in a bad language. Originally it was even worse because
I'd committed all the nonsense that venv caches and didn't care
because I didn't have time to think about it.

I'm only putting this up somewhere as a bit of nostalgic historical
curiousity, because why not.
